Goal: Analysis of wind energy production across the United States of America
(This is not final and subject to change at teams discretion) 
Novelty: combining data from EIN api and the ugs api to assess wind energy production in USA

Question 1) How much wind energy is produced and consumed in the USA?
Answer: 
How much total energy does the United States of America produce/consume
Analysis by year and by sector i.e. Coal, Nuclear, Renewable
Renewable  i.e. Solar, Wind, Geothermal
Wind (by year)

Question 2) Where does wind energy come from?
Answer:
Wind turbine deployment US/State/Month/Year ($?)
Map of USA with windmills

Question 3) How does the number of windmills impact wind energy production?
Map of USA with total wind energy in a year

Question 4) Where is the most wind energy produced?
Analysis by state (by month) Top 10 producers
Normalize to number of number of windmills
Correlation between number of windmill and the amount of power

Question 5) What does the next 5 years  of wind energy production look like? 
Using Prophet.

Question 6) Whatâ€™s the marginal benefit and marginal of wind turbine production and deployment in the USA.
Math.
