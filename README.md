# Project_1
Goal: Analysis of wind energy production across the United States of America
Novelty: combining data from EIN api and the ugs api to assess wind energy production in USA

We asked three broad questions that yielded several insightful answers:

Question 1) How much wind energy is produced and consumed in the USA?
Question 2) Where does wind energy come from?
Question 3) How does the number of windmills impact wind energy production?

The files that answer these questions are:

Question_1_aw.ipynb
Question_1_MF.ipynb

Question_2_MF.ipynb

Question_3_MF.ipynb
question3-chadi.ipynb

Associated and necessary files are:
